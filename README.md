# Year 2 Design and analysis of data structures and algorithms (DADSA) Coursework A 

This assignment is to produce a shopping schedule and delivery schedule that are tasked from the assignment in Python using the CSV files. Working on this assignment will help me develop the ability to relate organisational requirements into design choices for the storage and management of data. It will also help me practice my programming skills on Python and explore means by which the efficiency of my programming can improve.
